# Hey, I'm Muhammad Haseeb, Web Developer & Cybersecurity Enthusiast

Ever since I stepped into the world of tech, I've been passionate about creating secure and user-friendly digital solutions. What started as curiosity soon turned into a purposeful career, blending web development with cybersecurity to build tools that don't just work, but also protect.

I'm currently a senior **Cyber Security undergraduate** at [FAST NUCES Islamabad](https://isb.nu.edu.pk/). My work spans a wide range of projects. From responsive websites and conversion-focused landing pages to AI-powered vulnerability scanners, forensic analysis tools, and intelligent applications, all built using modern tech stacks like **React**, **Next.js**, **Node.js**, **Python**, **Firebase**, and the **MERN** stack. Over time, I've honed my expertise in **Front-End Development** by creating scalable, user-centric interfaces that offer intuitive and seamless experiences. I've also worked with platforms and tools such as **WordPress**, **Webflow**, **HubSpot**, **Shopify**, and **Figma**, allowing me to bring both creativity and precision to every build.

I've also had the privilege to lead outreach initiatives as Vice Head of Liaison & Outreach at [FAST Community Service Society](https://pk.linkedin.com/company/fcss-fast), managing partnerships and impact-driven campaigns.

Beyond the code, I'm passionate about building solutions that make a real impact. Whether that's empowering businesses through better digital experiences or contributing to a more secure online world. I'm always exploring new tools, frameworks, and ideas to stay ahead in both web development and cybersecurity. If you're interested in working together, discussing an idea, or just want to say hello feel free to reach out. I'd love to connect!
